# Research log

I am using this file to keep track of why I made decisions, not just what files I changed.

A useful entry for me answers four questions

1. What was I trying to figure out?
2. What did I do?
3. What did I learn?
4. What did I change?

## September 2026

I created the repository and wrote the first version of the study question and analysis plan.

I then did the first literature pass. The main thing that changed was the question itself.

I had originally been thinking more generally about whether normalization changes ECG model performance. The recent PTB-XL preprocessing work made that too broad. Preprocessing can already behave differently across model architectures, so I narrowed the study to a question I can test more cleanly.

I now want to see whether the same preprocessing choice can behave differently across diagnostic tasks while keeping the model and evaluation setup fixed.

I have not looked at the final model results yet. The next step is the data audit, where I will check the PTB-XL labels and freeze the task definitions before running the main comparison.
